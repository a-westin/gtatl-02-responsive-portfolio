## Installation
I have created a multi-page website, utilizing Bootstrap framework. The requirements, which I have done my best to meet, are as follows:


* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

## Usage
Clicking on one of the three tabs at the top of the page will direct the user to each respective section; About, Contact, or Portfolio.
